## Description <a name="description"></a>
An archive useful to collect Summer Schools for PhD Students, classified by research field. 
The goal of this repository is to provide a single source to find links and references to summer schools where PhD Students can enroll and partecipate. 
For each research field/area, there will be a list to accessible and interesting schools. The aim of this project is to help people find programs and schools, along with a brief description of its topics, the acceptance rate, and their validity for official certification and consequent acknowledgment by the university (currently based on the University of Milan). 

This project is meant to be a collective archive. If you want to contrubute with other summer schools not yet listed or related to your research area, please feel free to pull request this repository.
